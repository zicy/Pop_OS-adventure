# Trying KDE Plasma on Pop!_OS
Using X11 for now, and maybe Wayland latter ?

## Requirements
* hm

### Tasks
- [X] Install KDE Plasma
- [ ] Try it out, any customization needed ?



### Install KDE Plasma
Used guide from System76

```bash
sudo apt install kde-standard
```

Choose to continue with GDM3 for now.

After that simple restart and because its not the default to use KDE, remember to choose it during login.
